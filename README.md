# Banking-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This study predicts which bank customers will churn by means of machine learning modelling techniques. It presents a full machine learning work flow, use 11 Machine Learning algorithms, tune their parameters and ensemble the best n (e.g. 3) of them using their accuracy scores for the validation set.
